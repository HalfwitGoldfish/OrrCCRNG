RNG
Pulling in data from a local JSON file, you will create a designed Random Name Generator.
Have your application themed and make sure your list of names is the class plus the Instructors.

You also need to have a section that shows the previous 5 names that were pulled from your Random Name Generator.
Don't forget to have fun!!!

Damn bro this looks nice. Anyways, The styling is eye catching and nicely formatted. Looking at your code it looks great and I like how its just one function for your last 5 peers in contrast to mine
